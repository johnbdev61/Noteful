#Hello Daddy!

So, I'm nearly done. My fetch request for adding a note is not working. You can find the request in the AddNote.js file, and the function onAddNote is in the App.js file for setting the state.

I also have one component where I need to implement proptype and that's in the NoteCard.js file

Here is another repo to clone because you need because you have to host the api:
git clone https://github.com/tomatau/noteful-json-server
cd ./noteful-json-server
npm install
npm start
